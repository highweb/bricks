# UI Bricks

Highly flexible and compatible UI patterns for the web.


## Getting Started

1. run `yarn` to install dependencies
2. run `yarn start` to start developing


## Technologies used

### Storybook

We are not the only ones testing the project. External parties or clients check our projects. To make this as easy as possible for them, we've included [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
This way anyone can check the components in an isolated area to see if they are performing/looking the way they're supposed to.

The following command will start up Storybook. A url on which you can view storybook will be displayed in the terminal.

`yarn start`
